You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y. Y is the value of some function F at X -- i.e. Y = F(X).
Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X.

SELECT DISTINCT f1.x,f1.y 
FROM   functions f1 
       inner join functions f2 
               ON f1.x IN f2.y 
                  AND f1.y IN f2.x 
WHERE  f1.x < f1.y 
        OR f1.x IN (SELECT x 
                   FROM   functions 
                   WHERE  x = y 
                   GROUP  BY x,y 
                   HAVING Count(*) > 1) 
ORDER  BY f1.x;
